__*Project Description:*__
As an emerging data analyst I need to explore R libraries so, I can create more ease and efficiency in my work.

This project is all about R libraries. I plan to explore a few R libraries in this sprint. Including but not limited to:
- Rcolorbrewer
- OfficeR
- Lubridate
With these programs I am hoping to be able to make my work not only easier but also more esthetically pleasing.

*Here is a description of other things I hope to do with this project for future reference*
