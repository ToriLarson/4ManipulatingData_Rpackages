## PDF File Manipulation using the PDFtools Library in R

**Author:** Victoria Larson

__*Project Description:*__
As an emerging data analyst I need to explore R libraries so, I can create more ease and efficiency in my work.

This project is all about using libraries in R. I focused on one specific library which was PDFtools.

The goals of my project was to take a STR Report (Hotel Competitive set data), which was sent to me in a pdf format and upload it into R using PDFtools. The goal once it is imported and cleaned up is to analyze and manipulate the data.
